## [1.9.2] - 2025-10-16 
> **Note:** Version 1.9.1 was skipped due to a mistake

### Fix
- Fixed missing observer initialization after full page reload by manually calling `handleUrlChange()` in `setupUrlObserver`. This ensures all observers and features are correctly set up whether the user navigates via SPA or refreshes the browser.

## [1.9.0] - 2025-10-07

### Feature
- Added 8K to quality setting

### Refactor
- Renamed Extension to YouTube Custom Settings (updated everything related)

## [1.8.2] - 2025-09-22

- Member videos hiding : Added suggested videos support. (DOM only for now)


## [1.8.0] - 2025-07-30

### Feature
- Added a "Custom Quality Order" feature: you can now define a personalized priority list for video qualities. If enabled, the extension will always try to apply the first available quality from your custom list, instead of just the preferred quality.

### Changed
- Removed automatic reload of YouTube tabs on extension install. Instead, a clear warning is now displayed on the Welcome page, with a button allowing users to manually reload active YouTube tabs. Hibernating or backgroud tabs are ignored.


## [1.7.0] - 2025-07-25

### Feature
- Added a "duration rule" feature for video speed: you can now specify a rule so that videos longer or shorter than a chosen duration will always play at normal speed (x1), ignoring your custom speed setting.

- Audio Track feature : choose your default audio track (original or specified language)

### Changed
- Improved subtitle language preference storage by using a consistent, prefixed key (`yds-subtitlesLanguage`) in localStorage to prevent conflicts and ensure reliability.
